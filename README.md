# SQL-Guesthouse-Coursework
Coursework on Database Systems Module, Edinburgh Napier University

It is a guesthouse coursework. Part one is working with the database which was given to us. Part two are edits. I know that it's not perfect, but I am also a bit unsure where to fix it. 

I'm currently doing the Advanced Database Module. This coursework is for the regular database systems module and hence is less advanced.
